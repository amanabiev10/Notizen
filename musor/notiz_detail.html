        <p class="note-content">The provided information reveals the issue preventing your link styles from
            working as expected. It's a combination of factors:

            Inline Styles:

            The empty inline style attribute (style=" ") on your <a> element might be overriding the styles
                you're trying to apply through CSS classes. Even though it's empty, it still has higher
                specificity than external CSS rules.

                User Agent Stylesheet:

                The browser's default stylesheet (user agent stylesheet) defines styles for various HTML
                elements like <a>,
                    <li>, and
                        <ul>. These can sometimes interfere with your custom styles, especially if they have
                            lower specificity.

                            Solution:

                            Remove Inline Styles:

                            Completely remove the style attribute from your <a> element. This ensures that
                                external CSS rules have full control over the styling.

                                HTML
                                <a href="#" onclick="showPages('notizbuch1')" class="notizbuch-link">Notizbuch
                                    1</a>
                                Verwende den Code mit Vorsicht.

                                Increase Specificity (Optional):

                                If you're still encountering issues with the user agent styles, you can
                                increase the specificity of your CSS rule by adding an ID selector or
                                additional class names. However, this should be a last resort as it can make
                                your CSS harder to maintain.
